 * A Union data class is tagged union type. It can be represented in a number of ways in Java:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>interface: An interface allows multiple data representations as child classes.
 * <li>abstract class: Similar to an interface, an abstract or base class can have multiple data
 * representations.
 * <li>embedded union: A class with one or more fields where only one is present at any one time.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The members are the actual classes instead of a DataClass. This is to ensure that infinite
 * resolution loops do not occur.
